## Requirements

To use this tool, you need to install some third-party software and Python modules. Follow the instructions below to set up your environment:

### Third-Party Software

1. [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html): This tool is required for handling multimedia files. You can download it from [FFmpeg's official website](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) and follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.
2. [n_m3u8_dl-re](https://github.com/nilaoda/N_m3u8DL-RE/releases): This tool is used for downloading and processing m3u8 & mpd streams. Make sure to rename the downloaded binary to n_m3u8_dl-re (case-sensitive) for compatibility with this tool. You can find it on GitHub at [n_m3u8_dl-re](https://github.com/nilaoda/N_m3u8DL-RE/releases).
3. [MP4 Decrypt](https://www.bento4.com/downloads/): This software is necessary for decrypting MP4 files. You can download their SDK from their [official site](https://www.bento4.com/downloads/).

### DRM Decryption Requirements (for Auto-DRM feature)

4. **device.wvd**: A valid Widevine device file is required for automatic DRM key extraction. Place this file in the UDM directory.
5. **pywidevine**: Python library for Widevine CDM operations (included in requirements.txt).

### Python Modules

Install the required Python modules using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have a working Python environment and pip installed to handle the dependencies listed in requirements.txt.

## Getting Started

To use this tool, you'll need to set up a few prerequisites:

### Udemy Cookies

You need to provide Udemy cookies to authenticate your requests. To extract these cookies:

- Use the [Cookie Editor extension](https://cookie-editor.com/) (available for Chrome or Firefox).
- Extract the cookies as a Netscape format.
- Save the extracted cookies as `cookies.txt` and place this file in the same directory where you execute the tool.

### Decryption Key

UDM automatically handles DRM-protected videos with built-in key extraction:

#### Automatic Key Extraction (Default)

UDM automatically detects and extracts DRM keys when needed with lightning-fast detection:

```bash
python main.py --url "https://www.udemy.com/course/example-course" --captions en_US,vi_VN --concurrent 8 --srt
```

**ðŸ“‹ Language Codes**: See [UDEMY_LANGUAGE_CODES.md](UDEMY_LANGUAGE_CODES.md) for a complete list of supported subtitle languages. Common codes include:

- `en_US` (English), `es_ES` (Spanish), `fr_FR` (French), `de_DE` (German)
- `zh_CN` (Chinese), `ja_JP` (Japanese), `ko_KR` (Korean), `vi_VN` (Vietnamese)
- `pt_BR` (Portuguese), `it_IT` (Italian), `ru_RU` (Russian), `ar_SA` (Arabic)

**âš¡ Ultra-Fast Detection**: DRM detection now takes 0.5 seconds! DRM-free courses are detected instantly, and DRM courses start downloading immediately using smart on-demand key extraction. Keys are automatically extracted when needed and saved to `drm_keys.json`. You'll need a valid `device.wvd` file in the UDM directory.

#### Manual Key Override

If you already have a decryption key, you can still provide it manually:

```bash
python main.py --url "https://www.udemy.com/course/example-course" --key "kid:key_value"
```

> [!WARNING]
> Ensure you comply with all applicable laws and respect intellectual property rights when using DRM decryption features.

## Example Usage

### Basic Download

```bash
# Download course with automatic DRM key extraction
python main.py --url "https://www.udemy.com/course/example-course" --captions en_US,vi_VN --concurrent 8 --srt --chapter 21-25
```

### Manual Key Download

```bash
python main.py --url "https://www.udemy.com/course/example-course" --key "kid:key_value" --cookies /path/to/cookies.txt --concurrent 8 --captions en_US
```
